To install:

    python install_venv.py

This will install a virtual environment in .venv, which then
has the libraries needed.

To run a slide file:

    .venv/bin/sliderepl 01_engine_usage.py

If you'd prefer to use your own virtual environment, or the above
"all-in-one" setup is causing problems, the system can be installed using
the Python interpreter of your choice with "_install.py":

    /path/to/venv/python _install.py
